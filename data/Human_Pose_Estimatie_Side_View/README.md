# Human Pose Estimation - Side View

Our dataset is collected from match video recordings sourced from the internet. The video clip is a run-up segment of the Olympic long jump event, which was captured entirely by a side facing camera.

The existing models are significantly less effective in estimating the lateral posture of the human body compared to the frontal human body. So we proposed this dataset.

The following image is a video using YOLOv8-pose. This task clearly exhibits issues such as inaccurate estimation, left and right errors, and occlusion

The following image is the video that we have re-annotated.

Our dataset contains a total of 42 video clips, totaling 3650 frames.
